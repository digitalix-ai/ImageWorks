Image manipulation with Python

This is a work on image manipulation with Python. There are 2 Python files in this repository - thumbnail.py and JPGtoPNGconverter.py, doing manipulations with images and folders.
The file thumbnail.py works on the file history-in-hd-e5eDHbmHprg-unsplash.jpg, which is a high quality large picture, and makes a thumbnail (reduced size picture) out of it. It saves the new thumbnail into the file thumbnail.jpg. The Python library PIL is used here.
The file JPGtoPNGconverter.py works on the folder Pokedex and the 4 images inside, which are initially in jpg format. It creates new folder named 'new', where it saves the same image files, but in png format. It makes use of the Python modules sys, OS and PIL.
